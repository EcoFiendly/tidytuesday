About TidyTuesday

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project. The project was born out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, with an emphasis on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem. Check it out at: github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday.

I am going to be attempting most of it using Python, occasionally R to keep it in practice.
